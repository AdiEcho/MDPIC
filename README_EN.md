Make sure to edit the config.yml first.

- If you got the full python environment, you can run the script by:

```shell
python mdpic.py
```

- If not, you just need to click the mdpic.exe to run the script.

**When the script running background**

1. Copy a image from the website or take a screenshot by some other screenshot script (eg. Snipaste)
2. Press Ctrl + M to upload your images in the clipboard to your github page
3. The image's URL will send to your Clipboard, just paste it in your Markdown file.

ðŸ”¨ Improvement

I fail to hide the console, I tried the `pyinstaller -F -w` to build the .exe file, but it wasn't work, so I have to remove the option `-w` to build successfully.

If anyone got a suggestion can fix it, just Email me or make a pull requests. Thks! :smile:
